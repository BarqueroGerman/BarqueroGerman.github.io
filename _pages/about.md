I am German Barquero, a PhD student at Universitat de Barcelona, advised by Prof. Sergio Escalera. My main interests include human behavior analysis through computer vision and machine learning techniques, especially in adaptive and explainable human behavior forecasting.

In 2021, I obtained an MSc in Computer Vision from Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB), receiving the best student award. I carried out my Master's thesis in the [HuPBA group](https://sergioescalera.com/students/), led by [Sergio Escalera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oI6AIkMAAAAJ). There, I co-organized the [DYAD ICCV'21 workshop](https://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.es/workshop/44/description/) and led the Behavior Forecasting challenge track. Previously, I graduated in Mathematics and Computer Science from Universitat de Barcelona (UB). During my last year, I was awarded a scolarship to conduct my Bachelor's thesis in the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), co-supervised by [Jean-Philippe Thiran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mII-l2cAAAAJ) and [Meritxell Bach Cuadra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UoZ4neoAAAAJ).
