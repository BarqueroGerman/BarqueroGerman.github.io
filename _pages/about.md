I am German Barquero, a PhD student at [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/), advised by Prof. [Sergio Escalera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oI6AIkMAAAAJ) and Dr. [Cristina Palmero](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=V0c9xx0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao). My main interests lie in the intersection between human behavior understanding and generative AI. There, my recent contributions have focused on pushing the state of the art on conditional human motion synthesis.

In 2021, I obtained an MSc in Computer Vision from [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/) (UAB), and received the best student award. I carried out my Master's thesis in the [HuPBA group](https://sergioescalera.com/students/), led by [Sergio Escalera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oI6AIkMAAAAJ). There, I co-organized the [DYAD ICCV'21 workshop](https://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.es/workshop/44/description/) and led the [Behavior Forecasting challenge](https://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.cat/challenge/45/description/) track. Previously, I graduated in [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://mat.ub.edu/graumatesinfo/) from Universitat de Barcelona (UB). During my last year, I was awarded a scholarship to conduct my Bachelor's thesis in the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) (EPFL), advised by [Jean-Philippe Thiran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mII-l2cAAAAJ) and [Meritxell Bach Cuadra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UoZ4neoAAAAJ).
