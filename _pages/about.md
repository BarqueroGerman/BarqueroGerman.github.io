I am German Barquero, a PhD student at [Universitat de Barcelona](https://www.ub.edu/), advised by Prof. [Sergio Escalera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oI6AIkMAAAAJ). My main interests include human behavior analysis through computer vision and machine learning techniques, especially in adaptive and explainable human behavior forecasting.

In 2021, I obtained an MSc in Computer Vision from [Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat/) (UAB), and received the best student award. I carried out my Master's thesis in the [HuPBA group](https://sergioescalera.com/students/), led by [Sergio Escalera](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oI6AIkMAAAAJ). There, I co-organized the [DYAD ICCV'21 workshop](https://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.es/workshop/44/description/) and led the [Behavior Forecasting challenge](https://chalearnlap.cvc.uab.cat/challenge/45/description/) track. Previously, I graduated in [Mathematics and Computer Science](https://mat.ub.edu/graumatesinfo/) from Universitat de Barcelona (UB). During my last year, I was awarded a scolarship to conduct my Bachelor's thesis in the [École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne](https://www.epfl.ch/en/) (EPFL), advised by [Jean-Philippe Thiran](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=mII-l2cAAAAJ) and [Meritxell Bach Cuadra](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=UoZ4neoAAAAJ).
