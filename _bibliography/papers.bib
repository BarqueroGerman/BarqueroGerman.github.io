   abstract= {Non-verbal social human behavior forecasting has increasingly attracted the interest of the research community in recent years. Its direct applications to human-robot interaction and socially-aware human motion generation make it a very attractive field. In this survey, we define the behavior forecasting problem for multiple interactive agents in a generic way that aims at unifying the fields of social signals prediction and human motion forecasting, traditionally separated. We hold that both problem formulations refer to the same conceptual problem, and identify many shared fundamental challenges: future stochasticity, context awareness, history exploitation, etc. We also propose a taxonomy that comprises methods published in the last 5 years in a very informative way and describes the current main concerns of the community with regard to this problem. In order to promote further research on this field, we also provide a summarised and friendly overview of audiovisual datasets featuring non-acted social interactions. Finally, we describe the most common metrics used in this task and their particular issues.},

   abstract= {Human behavior forecasting during human-human interactions is of utmost importance to provide robotic or virtual agents with social intelligence. This problem is especially challenging for scenarios that are highly driven by interpersonal dynamics. In this work, we present the first systematic comparison of state-of-the-art approaches for behavior forecasting. To do so, we leverage whole-body annotations (face, body, and hands) from the very recently released UDIVA v0.5, which features face-to-face dyadic interactions. Our best attention-based approaches achieve state-of-the-art performance in UDIVA v0.5. We show that by autoregressively predicting the future with methods trained for the short-term future (<400ms), we outperform the baselines even for a considerably longer-term future (up to 2s). We also show that this finding holds when highly noisy annotations are used, which opens new horizons towards the use of weakly-supervised learning. Combined with large-scale datasets, this may help boost the advances in this field.},

In this paper we present a long-term, multi-face tracking architecture conceived for working in crowded contexts where faces are often the only visible part of a person. Our system benefits from advances in the fields of face detection and face recognition to achieve long-term tracking, and is particularly unconstrained to the motion and occlusions of people. It follows a tracking-by-detection approach, combining a fast short-term visual tracker with a novel online tracklet reconnection strategy grounded on rank-based face verification. The proposed rank-based constraint favours higher inter-class distance among tracklets, and reduces the propagation of errors due to wrong reconnections. Additionally, a correction module is included to correct past assignments with no extra computational cost. We present a series of experiments introducing novel specialized metrics for the evaluation of long-term tracking capabilities, and publicly release a video dataset with 10 manually annotated videos and a total length of 8' 54". Our findings validate the robustness of each of the proposed modules, and demonstrate that, in these challenging contexts, our approach yields up to 50% longer tracks than state-of-the-art deep learning trackers.}

    <b>Background and objective</b><br>
    Compared to the conventional magnetization-prepared rapid gradient-echo imaging (MPRAGE) MRI sequence, the specialized magnetization prepared 2 rapid acquisition gradient echoes (MP2RAGE) shows a higher brain tissue and lesion contrast in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients. The goal of this work is to retrospectively generate realistic-looking MP2RAGE uniform images (UNI) from already acquired MPRAGE images in order to improve the automatic lesion and tissue segmentation.
    <br><b>Methods</b><br>
    For this task we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN). Multi-contrast MRI data of 12 healthy controls and 44 patients diagnosed with MS was retrospectively analyzed. Imaging was acquired at 3T using a SIEMENS scanner with MPRAGE, MP2RAGE, FLAIR, and DIR sequences. We train the GAN with both healthy controls and MS patients to generate synthetic MP2RAGE UNI images. These images were then compared to the real MP2RAGE UNI (considered as ground truth) analyzing the output of automatic brain tissue and lesion segmentation tools. Reference-based metrics as well as the lesion-wise true and false positives, Dice coefficient, and volume difference were considered for the evaluation. Statistical differences were assessed with the Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
    <br><b>Results</b><br>
    The synthetic MP2RAGE UNI significantly improves the lesion and tissue segmentation masks in terms of Dice coefficient and volume difference (p-values < 0.001) compared to the MPRAGE. For the segmentation metrics analyzed no statistically significant differences are found between the synthetic and acquired MP2RAGE UNI.
    <br><b>Conclusion</b><br>
    Synthesized MP2RAGE UNI images are visually realistic and improve the output of automatic segmentation tools.

  abstract={<b>Objectives</b><br>
    In multiple sclerosis (MS), the presence of a paramagnetic rim at the edge of non-gadolinium-enhancing lesions indicates perilesional chronic inflammation. Patients featuring a higher paramagnetic rim lesion burden tend to have more aggressive disease. The objective of this study was to develop and evaluate a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture (RimNet) for automated detection of paramagnetic rim lesions in MS employing multiple magnetic resonance (MR) imaging contrasts.
    <br><b>Materials and methods</b><br>
    Imaging data were acquired at 3 Tesla on three different scanners from two different centers, totaling 124 MS patients, and studied retrospectively. Paramagnetic rim lesion detection was independently assessed by two expert raters on T2*-phase images, yielding 462 rim-positive (rim+) and 4857 rim-negative (rim-) lesions. RimNet was designed using 3D patches centered on candidate lesions in 3D-EPI phase and 3D FLAIR as input to two network branches. The interconnection of branches at both the first network blocks and the last fully connected layers favors the extraction of low and high-level multimodal features, respectively. RimNet’s performance was quantitatively evaluated against experts’ evaluation from both lesion-wise and patient-wise perspectives. For the latter, patients were categorized based on a clinically relevant threshold of 4 rim+ lesions per patient. The individual prediction capabilities of the images were also explored and compared (DeLong test) by testing a CNN trained with one image as input (unimodal).
    <br><b>Results</b><br>
    The unimodal exploration showed the superior performance of 3D-EPI phase and 3D-EPI magnitude images in the rim+/- classification task (AUC = 0.913 and 0.901), compared to the 3D FLAIR (AUC = 0.855, Ps < 0.0001). The proposed multimodal RimNet prototype clearly outperformed the best unimodal approach (AUC = 0.943, P < 0.0001). The sensitivity and specificity achieved by RimNet (70.6% and 94.9%, respectively) are comparable to those of experts at the lesion level. In the patient-wise analysis, RimNet performed with an accuracy of 89.5% and a Dice coefficient (or F1 score) of 83.5%.
    <br><b>Conclusions</b><br>
    The proposed prototype showed promising performance, supporting the usage of RimNet for speeding up and standardizing the paramagnetic rim lesions analysis in MS.
